name: rwd-flexible-image
class:

# .red-text[Flexible Images]

```css
img {
	max-width: 100%;
	height: auto;
}
```

### - images should only ever be as large as their physical width in pixels
### - if nested inside a smaller parent container, then the image should shrink
### - height will be calculated automatically, will maintain original aspect ratio

---

name: rwd-media-query
class:

# .red-text[Media Queries]

```css
@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px) {

  /* ... styles here ... */

}
```

### - inspect the physical characteristics of the device rendering our work
### - CSS will only be applied when specific conditions are met (e.g. browser reaches a specific width)
### - asking the device if its horizontal screen size .red-text[(max-device-width)] is equal to or less than 480px

# .red-text[Anatomy of a Media Query]

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) {

### - media type (all, screen, print, tv, ...)
### - the query itself wrapped in parentheses
### - name of feature
### - corresponding value

## In the W3C specs, every device as a .red-text["display area"] and .red-text["rendering surface."]

# .red-text[display area] = browser viewport = browser window
# .red-text[rendering surface] = entire display = screen

### `width` = display area width = viewport width
### `height` = display area height = viewport height
### `device-width` = rendering surface width = screen width
### `device-height` = rendering surface height = screen height

name: rwd-mobile-viewport
class:

# .red-text[Mobile Browser Viewport]

### - mobile browsers render pages in a virtual "window" (the viewport)
### - this viewport is usually wider than the physical screen (e.g. .red-text[980px] for mobile Safari)
### - that way these browsers don't need to squeeze every page layout into a tiny window
### - which would break many non-mobile-optimized sites
### - users can pan and zoom to see different areas of the page

class:

# .red-text[Viewport Meta Tag History]

### - mobile Safari introduced the "viewport meta tag"
### - to let web developers control the viewport's size and scale
### - many other mobile browsers now support this tag
### - but it is not part of any web standard

class:

# .red-text[Viewport Meta Tag]

### - a typical mobile-optimized page contains something like:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### - `width` property controls the size of the viewport
### - can be set to a specific number of pixels (e.g. `width=320`)
### - or to `device-width` which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%
### - `initial-scale` controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded

class:

# .red-text[Mobile First Development Approach]

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200) { ... }
```

### - can be tricky to cram a multi-column layout into a smaller screen space
### - itâ€™s much better to start simple, then work upwards to more complex designs
