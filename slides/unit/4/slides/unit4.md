# .red-text[CSS Selectors]

## - ID Selector
## - Class Selector
## - Tag Selector
## - Child Selector
## - Descendant Selector

---
name: css-id-selector
class:

## ID Selector
Matches an element whose `id` attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol.

.float-left[

### .red-text[CSS]
```css
#happy-cake {

}
```
]

.float-right[

### .red-text[HTML]
```html
<!-- WILL match -->
<div id="happy-cake"></div>

<!-- WILL match -->
<aside id="happy-cake"></aside>

<!-- Will NOT match -->
<div id="sad-cake">Wrong ID!</div>

<!-- Will NOT match -->
<div class="happy-cake">That's not an ID!</div>
```
]

???

ID selectors are the most powerful type of selector in terms of CSS specificity. Meaning that they beat out other types of selectors and the styles defined within win. That sounds good, but that's typically considered bad, because it's nice to have lower-specificity selectors that are easier to override when needed.

---
name: css-class-selector
class:

## Class Selector
Matches an element whose `class` attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period symbol.

.float-left[

### .red-text[CSS]
```css
.module {

}
```
]

.float-right[

### .red-text[HTML]
```html
<!-- WILL match -->
<div class="module"></div>

<!-- WILL match -->
<aside class="country module iceland"></aside>

<!-- Will NOT match -->
<div class=".module">The dot is for CSS, not HTML</div>

<!-- Will NOT match -->
<div class="bigmodule">Wrong class</div>
```
]

Class selectors are your friend. They are probably the most useful and versatile selectors out there. In part because they are well supported in all browsers. In part because you can add multiple classes (just separated by a space) on HTML elements. In part because there are JavaScript things you can do specifically for manipulating classes.

---
name: css-tag-selector
class:

## Tag Selector
Matches HTML element names.

.float-left[

### .red-text[CSS]
```css
h2 {

}
```
]

.float-right[

### .red-text[HTML]
```html
<!-- WILL match -->
<h2>Hi, Mom</h2>

<main>
  <div>
     <!-- WILL match -->
     <h2>Anywhere</h2>
  </div>
</main>

<!-- Will NOT match -->
<h2class="yolo">Make sure that tag has a space after it!</h2>
```
]

???

Tag selectors are at their most useful when changing properties that are unique to that HTML element. Like setting the list-style on a <ul> or tab-size on a <pre>. Also in reset stylesheets where you are specifically trying to unset styles that browsers apply to certain elements.

Don't rely on the them too much though. It's typically more useful to have a class define styling that you can use on any HTML element.

---
name: css-child-selector
class:

## Child Selector
Matches an element that is a direct child of another.

.float-left[

### .red-text[CSS]
```css
li > a {
  color: tomato;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```
]

.float-right[

### .red-text[HTML]
```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="#">WILL be selected</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">WILL be selected</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#">WILL NOT be selected</a></p>
```
]

???

A child selector in CSS is the "greater than" symbol. It means "select elements that are direct descendants only". In this case: "select list items that are direct descendants of an ordered list".


---
name: css-descendant-selector
class:

## Descendant Selector
Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element (not just a direct child of that element.)

.float-left[

### .red-text[CSS]
```css
ul li {  }
header h2  {  }
footer a  {  }
.module div {  }
#info-toggle span  {  }
div span  {  }
```
]

.float-right[

### .red-text[HTML]
```html
<div>
  <span>I will match</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
       <span>I will match too</span>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>
```
]

???

A descendant selector in CSS is any selector with white space between two selectors without a combinator. Descendant means anywhere nested within it in the DOM tree. Could be a direct child, could be five levels deep, it is still a descendant. This is different than a child combinator (>) which requires the element to be the next nested level down.

* All elements contained within a given element are said to be its .red-text[descendants].
* An element that's directly contained within another element is said to be a .red-text[child] of that element.
* The containing element is the .red-text[parent].
* All elements higher up than a particular element in the tree are its .red-text[ancestors].

name: css-cascade
class: center

# Conflict Resolution: .red-text[The Cascade]

### - Multiple stylesheets per document

### - .red-text[The Cascade] assigns weights to sources of style info.

### - Style info .red-text["cascades down"] until it is overridden by a style rule with more weight.

### - Generally speaking, .red-text[the closer the stylesheet is to the content , the more weight it is given.]

???
* CSS allows us to apply several stylesheets to the same document, which means there are bound to be conflicts.

* .red-text[The Cascade is a hierarchical system] that assigns different weights to the various sources of style information.

* When several sources of style info vie for control of HTML elements, style info is passed down .red-text[("cascades down")] until it is overridden by a style rule with more weight.

* Generally speaking, .red-text[the closer the stylesheet is to the content , the more weight it is given.]

name: css-stylesheet-hierarchy
class: center

# .red-text[Stylesheet Hierarchy]

### From general to specific:

-Browser default styles (user agent stylesheet)

-User styles (reader stylesheet)

-Linked external stylesheet (`<link>` element in `<head>`)

-Imported stylesheet (`@import`)

-Embedded stylesheets (`<style>` element in `<head>`)

-Inline style rule(s) (`style` attribute in HTML opening tag)

-Any style rule makred `!important` by the author

-Any style rule marked `!important` by the reader (user)

---
name: css-specificity
class: center

# Conflict Resolution: .red-text[Specificity]

### -Specificity determines, which CSS rule is applied by the browsers.

### - Specificity is usually the reason why your CSS rules don't apply to some elements.

### - Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

### -If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.

---
name: css-specificity-101
class:

# .red-text[Specificity 101]

### Cascade continues at the rule level:

* When 2 rules in a single stylesheet conflict, type of selector determines winner.
* When selectors have an equal specificity value, the latest rule wins.

* The .red-text[more specific the selector], the more weight is given to override conflicting declarations.
  * ID selectors (`#happy-cake`)
  * class selectors (`.happy-cake`)
  * contextual element selectors (`nav ul`)
  * individual element selectors (`ul`)

* they may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements

* do not begin on a new line
* fall into the normal flow of a document
* lining up one after the other
* .red-text[only maintain the width of their content]
* may be nested inside one another
