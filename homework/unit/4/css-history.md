## Setup
  * Create a `homework` folder in your git repository.
  * [Download](https://github.com/tkraak/fewd-fall-2015/blob/gh-pages/homework/unit/4/css-history.html) the `css-history.html` [practice file](https://github.com/tkraak/fewd-fall-2015/blob/gh-pages/homework/unit/4/css-history.html) and place it into your homework folder.
  * Create a stylesheet document and name it `css-history.css` and place it "next to" `css-history.html` in your local folder structure. Make sure you are in your repo.
  * Commit frequently to your local repository and push to your remote repository on GitHub as needed.      

## Warm-up
  * Familiarize yourself with the structure and markup of `css-history.html` by indenting nested elements using soft-tabs with two spaces (the default in Atom and SublimeText.)
  * `css-history.html` contains a variety of errors. Fix as many of them as possible and bring the document up to HTML5 specifications.
  * Make use of HTML comments for your own notes and to aid in-class discussion.
  * Markup all quoted text (text enclosed in quotation marks) with the `<blockquote>` element.
  * Wire up `css-history.css` as an external stylesheet for `css-history.html`.

## Style
  * Use a [tag selector](http://www.webfreely.com/slides/unit/4/#17) to color the headline [red](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
  * Use an [ID selector](http://www.webfreely.com/slides/unit/4/#15) to color the very first list item [green](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
   * Use a [class selector](http://www.webfreely.com/slides/unit/4/#16) to set all dates/years to bold and italic.
  * Use a [child selector](http://www.webfreely.com/slides/unit/4/#18) to color the `Font information can be used to download font subsets over the Web` list item [pink](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
  * Use a [descendant selector](http://www.webfreely.com/slides/unit/4/#19) to give all `<blockquotes>` a [gray](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) background color.
  * **BONUS:** Set the entire document in a `sans-serif` [font](http://fontcdn.org/) and sensible `line-height` of your choosing.
